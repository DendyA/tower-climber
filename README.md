Tower Climber was a project for Seng 350 at the University of Victoria for the Fall 2020 semester. The original project was developed by Glen, Conor, and I.  The game uses Phaser for physics and rendering capabilities.

This game was a rudimentary foray into how server-client architectures work.

To install the required modules:
``npm install``

To start the server:
``npm start``
OR
``node src/server.js``
